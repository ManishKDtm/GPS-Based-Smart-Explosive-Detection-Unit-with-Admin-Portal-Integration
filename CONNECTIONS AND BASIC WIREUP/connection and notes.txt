ðŸ”§ Components Used
This project involves two main modules: an ESP32-based Mine-Detecting Rover and an ESP32-CAM Live Streaming Unit. Both are powered and controlled independently, communicating over a local network.

ðŸ“¦ Rover Unit (ESP32-based)
Primary Controller: ESP32 Dev Board

ðŸ§© Electronics:

| Component                  | Purpose / Description   |
| ESP32 Dev Board        | Main controller for mine detection and motor control             |
| Metal Detector Sensor  | Detects presence of metal/mines via digital input pin            |
| L293D Motor Driver     | Dual H-Bridge motor driver to control rover's movement           |
| DC Geared Motors (x4)  | Drives the rover, one for each side                              |
| PWM Control (ENA/ENB)  | Speed control for left/right motors via PWM pins                 |
| I2C LCD Display (16x2) | Real-time display of status, coordinates, and detection          |
| GPS Module (Neo-6M)    | Fetches current coordinates (connected via `HardwareSerial`)     |
| ESP32 Pins Used:       | `a1(32), a2(14), b1(12), b2(13), ena(25), enb(26), metalPin(15)` |


ðŸ“· ESP32-CAM Live Streaming Unit
Primary Controller: AI-Thinker ESP32-CAM

ðŸ§© Electronics:
| Component                      | Purpose / Description |
| ESP32-CAM (AI-Thinker)     | Video streaming unit with onboard OV2640 camera   |
| Camera Module (OV2640)     | Captures live video feed at QVGA resolution       |
| Onboard Flash LED (GPIO 4) | Optional lighting for low-light environments      |
| Power Supply               | 5V regulated supply for ESP32-CAM                 |
| Wi-Fi                      | Stream live MJPEG feed to browser on same network |



ðŸ”Œ Power Supply Requirements

| Unit        | Voltage | Current (Approx.) |
| ESP32 Rover | 5V      | â‰¥ 1A              |
| ESP32-CAM   | 5V      | â‰¥ 700mA           |
| Motors      | 6â€“12V   | Based on spec     |




ðŸ›  Additional Notes
Communication Between ESP32 & ESP32-CAM is handled over Wi-Fi, no physical wiring is needed between them.

Ensure secure power supply and voltage regulation (especially for ESP32-CAM) to avoid brownouts.

Firebase security is currently open for development â€“ not recommended for production.
